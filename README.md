## Introduction

Official implementation of LLaVa-Rad, introduced in ["A clinically accessible small multimodal radiology model and evaluation metric for chest X-ray findings"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58344-x).

LLaVA-Rad can take in as input a frontal chest X-ray and optionally a reason for exam and will output the corresponding findings.

**Note:** if you are interested in radiologist aligned evaluation of generated reports, we recommend you use the [CheXprompt](https://github.com/microsoft/chexprompt) codebase.

## Requirements

We trained and tested LLaVA-Rad using Python 3.10. For optimal inference, we recommend using a GPU environment. LLaVA-Rad has been tested on NVIDIA V100 and A100 GPUs with CUDA 11.x (or newer) drivers, on recent versions of Ubuntu.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up LLaVA-Rad:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/LLaVA-Rad.git
   cd LLaVA-Rad
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10):
   ```Shell
   conda create -n llavarad python=3.10 -y
   conda activate llavarad
   ```
3. Upgrade pip and install the package:
   ```Shell
   pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
   pip install -e .
   ```
4. [Optional] Install additional dependencies for training:
   ```bash
   pip install ninja
   pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
   ```

## Train

When starting from scratch, the following checkpoints are needed:
- A pre-trained LM checkpoint, e.g., [lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5)
- By default, we use a customized domain-specific ViT, BiomedCLIP-CXR. See [README.md](./llava/model/multimodal_encoder/open_clip_encoder/README.md) for details.

### 0. Preparation
Before running the commands below, you need to have the data, image folder, and the above checkpoints ready. 

**0.1 Data**

To download the data, sign the data use agreement and follow the instructions for download at [LLaVA-Rad MIMIC-CXR Annotations on PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/llava-rad-mimic-cxr-annotation/1.0.0/). This will include reports with extracted sections in LLaVA format, split into train/dev/test.

**0.2 Images**

You need to download the [MIMIC-CXR-JPG images from PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/) by signing the data use agreement and following the instructions.

**0.3 Model weights**

You can find the pretrained model weights for BiomedCLIP-CXR and LLaVA-Rad at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/llava-rad.


**Notes before proceeding:** 
- Change the paths in the scripts below according to where you downloaded the data.
- Batch size is set for 4-GPU machines. If your machine has a difference number of GPUs, please change batch size. Training commands have been tested on a single 80GB A100 and 4x80GB H100, using torch 2.4.1 and cuda 11.8 with flash attention 2.7.2.post1.

### 1. Pretrain (Alignment)
At this stage, we only train the projection layer (which aligns the vision features with text features). The vision encoder and LLM are all frozen.

```bash
bash scripts/pretrain.sh
```

We get a pretrained projector `mm_projector.bin` after pretraining.

### 2. Fine-tuning (LoRA)
Once we have a pretrained projector, we can do fine-tuning. The command below fine-tunes the projector and LoRA of LLM:
```bash
bash scripts/finetune_lora.sh
```

## Inference

Before running the command below, you need to change the script accordingly.

```bash
bash scripts/eval.sh
```

**Note:** To reproduce the evaluation results from the manuscript on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, changing the script means uncommenting and updating the paths for `query_file` and `image_folder`.

In the manuscript, the Open-I and CheXpert chest X-ray images and reports are also used for evaluation. These datasets are available at their corresponding sources: [Open-I](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/faq) | [CheXpert](https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/5158c524-d3ab-4e02-96e9-6ee9efc110a1).

## Evaluation

If you have run inference using multiple GPUs and have a resulting set of chunks with results, make sure you concatenate prediction chunks into a single file before running the following command:
```bash
cd llava/eval/rr_eval
python run.py ${YOUR_PREDICTION_FILE}
```
