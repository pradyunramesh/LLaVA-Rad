The opacities are combined to small pleural effusions and show multiple air bronchograms. The changes are likely to reflect centralized pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax.",1.890625
10122,train/patient53175/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The patient is status post median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in the postoperative period. Improving bibasilar atelectasis and persistent small pleural effusions. No visible pneumothorax.,2.1328125
10123,train/patient28988/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The aortic arch is calcified. The descending aorta is mildly ectatic. The heart is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery contour is mildly prominent. There is no pleural effusion. A right sixth rib fracture appears old.,2.1015625
10124,train/patient53932/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"The patient has received a left pectoral pacemaker. The leads are in correct position. There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema. No pneumonia.",2.30078125
10125,train/patient42147/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"The left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. No evidence of acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.",1.890625
10126,train/patient51410/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The left subclavian catheter extends to the mid portion of the SVC. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion or pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.,2.322265625
10127,train/patient42271/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The patient has taken a much better inspiration. There is still substantial opacification at the right base consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Less prominent opacification is seen at the left base. Blunting of the costophrenic angles is consistent with small pleural effusions. No evidence of vascular congestion.,2.009765625
10128,train/patient41861/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. The pleural surfaces are clear without effusion or pneumothorax.,2.484375
10129,train/patient57968/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"The patient has taken a better inspiration. There is continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with the mediastinal structures slightly shifted towards the left. The pulmonary vascular congestion has substantially improved. There is some increased opacification at the left base, raising the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.",1.89453125
10130,train/patient44572/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. A left apical chest tube remains in place. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes remain stable. There is persistent opacification of the left costophrenic angle, which may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis. Right pleural effusion has essentially resolved. There is no overt pulmonary edema.",1.7861328125
10131,train/patient13961/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. Underlying trauma board is in place. The lungs appear clear. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. The heart appears top normal. Mediastinal contour is normal. No bony abnormalities are seen.,1.7578125
10132,train/patient21214/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided. The lungs are clear and well expanded. No supine evidence for effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Bony structures are intact.,1.86328125
10133,train/patient23503/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,The lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. No displaced fracture is seen.,2.064453125
10134,train/patient33118/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"The right subclavian catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, though the side hole is above the esophagogastric junction. Low lung volumes accentuate the transverse diameter of the heart. No definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia.",2.27734375
10135,train/patient63203/study1/view1_frontal.jpg,"As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.  The right internal
 jugular vein catheter remains in situ.  The lung volumes have slightly
 decreased.  There is unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly with areas of
 atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung regions.  No overt pulmonary edema.  No
 larger pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.",1.54296875
